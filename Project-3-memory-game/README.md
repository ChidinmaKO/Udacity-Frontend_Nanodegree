## Project Overview

The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match. 

All matching cards are in an array of shuffled cards. If the 2 cards don't match, they will be flipped face down and can be reselected again. If the cards match, they will be visible.

This game is won when all matched cards are found. A game score, the time spent playing the game and the number of moves made are displayed after the game is over.
