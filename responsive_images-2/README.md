## Current Problems with the Page ##

* There are markup alternatives to using images. In this part of the project, try replacing, adjusting or otherwise removing images that are just adding bytes to the page.

## General Advice ##

What else can you accomplish in markup? Try experimenting with font icons, unicode characters, and CSS effects to create natively responsive images.
