## Current Problems with the Page ##

* The `<picture>` element allows browsers to decide which image to display based on media queries and device pixel ratios. Right now, the page is downloading images that are simply too big and waste too many bytes. How low can you get the page weight once the browser starts downloading images that are as small as possible?
* `alt` attributes make your sites accessible to the vision impaired and anyone surfing the web on a screen reader. Make sure to include them!
* The blog is visually simple. What can you do to make it look better?
